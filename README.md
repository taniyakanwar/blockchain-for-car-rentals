## Project Title

**Car Rental Blockchain Platform**

---

## Project Description

The **Car Rental Blockchain Platform** is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain that enables individuals to rent cars directly from each other, without the need for intermediaries like car rental agencies. The platform ensures trust, security, and transparency by leveraging blockchain technology to handle rental transactions.

This platform allows users to create car rental listings, set rental prices, and rent cars using AptosCoin as a payment method. All transactions are securely logged on the blockchain, providing an immutable record of car rentals and payments.

- Empower car owners to monetize their vehicles.
- Provide a more cost-effective and efficient rental experience for users.
- Eliminate intermediaries and reduce fees associated with traditional car rental companies.
- Foster a transparent, secure, and decentralized rental system through blockchain technology.
